# The-Blind-s-Quest
A RPG text-based game, developed in C (with classes)

This is my first game using C with classes (first experiece with C++). It was in 2011, in "Fundamentos da Programação II" subject.
This game opened a new category of text-based games in "Tecnologia em Jogos Digitais" course at PUCPR, becoming a required homework in "Oficina de Desenvolvimento de Jogos I" to get the subject credits.

Very ugly code, but very nice game (one of my preferred of all until nowadays).
