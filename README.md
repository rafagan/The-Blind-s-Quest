# The-Blind-s-Quest
A RPG pure text and ascii-art based game, developed in C (with classes)

This was my first game using C with classes (first experiece with C++). It was in 2011, in "Fundamentos da Programação II" subject.
This game opened a new category of ascii-art based games in "Tecnologia em Jogos Digitais" course at PUCPR, becoming a required homework in "Oficina de Desenvolvimento de Jogos I" to get the subject credits.

Very ugly code, but very nice game (one of my preferred of all until nowadays).

Developed in Visual Studio 2011, using MSVC++ 10.0.
